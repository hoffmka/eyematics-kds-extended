### Logical Definition (CLD)

This value set includes codes based on the following rules:

* Include codes from[`http://snomed.info/sct`](http://www.snomed.org/)version Not Stated (use latest from terminology server) where concept descends from 57368009 (Contact lenses)
* Include codes from[`http://snomed.info/sct`](http://www.snomed.org/)version Not Stated (use latest from terminology server) where concept descends from 50121007 (Eye glasses, device (physical object))
* Include codes from[`http://snomed.info/sct`](http://www.snomed.org/)version Not Stated (use latest from terminology server) where concept descends from 420330007 (Trial lens (physical object))

 Explanation of the columns that may appear on this page: 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Level | A few code lists that FHIR defines are hierarchical - each code is assigned a level. In this scheme, some codes are under other codes, and imply that the code they are under also applies |
| System | The source of the definition of the code (when the value set draws in codes defined elsewhere) |
| Code | The code (used as the code in the resource instance) |
| Display | The display (used in the*display*element of a[Coding](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/datatypes.html#Coding)). If there is no display, implementers should not simply display the code, but map the concept into their application |
| Definition | An explanation of the meaning of the concept |
| Comments | Additional notes about how to use the code |
